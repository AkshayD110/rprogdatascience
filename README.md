# R Programming for Data Science
## Roger D. Peng

This repository contains the files for the book *R Programming for Data Science*, as it is built on [bookdown.org](). This book was originally published on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming/) (and still is). The two versions are identical.


### Before You Start

Before building the book with the bookdown package, you need to unzip the `book_datasets.zip` file, which contains the datasets referenced in some of the chapters.
